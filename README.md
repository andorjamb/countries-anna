# 'Countries of the World' ReactApp 

Project work for React Advanced classes at Helsinki Business College, 2023.

This is a single page app written in JavaScript using React Redux and the !(REST countries)[https://restcountries.com/] and !(Open Weather Map)[https://openweathermap.org/] APIS.

## Additional libraries and dependencies

React-Bootstrap with additional custom CSS is used for component styling. 

The dotenv library is included as a dependency in package.json for accessing environment variables. An API key is required for data fetching from Open Weather Map. This should be stored in an .env file at the project root, as follows:
```REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY: <your key>```

Axios should also be installed for fetches from the weather api.
