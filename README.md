# 'Countries of the World' ReactApp 

Project work for React Advanced classes at Helsinki Business College, 2023.

This is a single page app written in JavaScript using React Redux and using the !(REST countries)[https://restcountries.com/] and !(Open Weather Map)[https://openweathermap.org/] APIS.

## Additional libraries and dependencies

Bootstrap with additional custom CSS is used for component styling. 
An API key is required for data fetching from Open Weather Map. This should be stored in an .env file at the project root, as follows:
```REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY: <your key>```

The dotenv library is included as a dependency in package.json.

Axios should also be installed for fetches from the weather api.

This project uses RTK Query from redux toolkit for data fetches from the REST countries API. (No additional packages needed.)
